Machine Learning Work Bench

forked from AdilKh4n/MachineLearningPlayground

<h2> Description </h2>

This is the local version of the cloud based application that provides a unified platform for building Machine Learning models. It is a web application that exposes scikit-learn library as a service. It serves as an interactive platform for parameter tuning, feature selection and model evaluation.

<b>Note:</b> With a few changes, this application can be customized to be hosted on the cloud. I had hosted this application on AWS EC2 and used AWS S3 as a storage layer for the application.
